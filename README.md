# Compose Dual-Rollup Local Stack

This project spins up two **Compose** rollups ("Rollup A" and "Rollup B") that settle to the Hoodi L1 network. It lets you deploy fresh rollups, run them locally, and iterate on the `ssvlabs/op-geth` fork and the shared publisher without leaving your machine.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker 27+ with Compose v2
- Python 3
- Git with SSH access to `git@github.com:ssvlabs/rollup-shared-publisher.git`
- A funded Hoodi L1 wallet and EL & CL RPC endpoints

### Steps
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in:
   - `HOODI_EL_RPC`
   - `HOODI_CL_RPC`
   - `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` / `WALLET_ADDRESS`
2. Bootstrap the stack on Hoodi:
   ```sh
   ./compose up
   ```
   First setup takes about 5 minutes.
3. Check `./compose status` to confirm Rollup A/B and the publisher are healthy.

## Iterate on Code Changes

- Set `OP_GETH_PATH` or `ROLLUP_SHARED_PUBLISHER_PATH` in `.env` if you want to build from external checkouts instead of the defaults (`./services/op-geth` and `./services/rollup-shared-publisher`).
- Rebuild and restart with `./compose deploy op-geth` or `./compose deploy publisher`.

## Command Cheat Sheet

- `./compose status` – show container states, RPC endpoints, contract addresses, and latest L2 blocks.
- `./compose down` – stop containers without removing anything.
- `./compose deploy op-geth` – rebuild and deploy op-geth on both rollups.
- `./compose deploy` – rebuild and deploy everything
- `./compose logs op-geth-a` - show op-geth logs for rollup A.
- `./compose logs --follow publisher` - follow publisher logs.
- `./compose purge --force` – stop the stack, remove volumes, and delete generated artifacts.
- `./toolkit.sh debug-bridge` – inspect recent cross-rollup mailbox activity.

## Customize Later

All additional knobs live in `.env`. Notable toggles:
- `DEPLOY_CONTRACTS=0` to skip helper contract deployment.
- `ROLLUP_ACCOUNT_DEPOSIT_WEI` and friends to control automatic L1 deposits.
- `OP_GETH_PATH` / `ROLLUP_SHARED_PUBLISHER_PATH` / `CONTRACTS_SOURCE` to point at existing checkouts so the CLI skips cloning into `./services`.
- `ROLLUP_A_CHAIN_ID` / `ROLLUP_B_CHAIN_ID` if you need different test chain IDs (defaults are 77777/88888).

For deeper operational notes, consult `AGENTS.md` (contributor workflow) and `docs/optimism-guide.md` (background reference).

## Blockscout Explorers

The stack now ships a Blockscout instance per rollup:

- Rollup A explorer: `http://localhost:19000`
- Rollup B explorer: `http://localhost:29000`

Each explorer is pre-configured with the rollup RPC, Hoodi L1 RPC, and the appropriate SystemConfig / helper contracts via `networks/rollup-*/blockscout.env`. The UI is served by an Nginx proxy that also forwards `/api` to the backend, so the REST API stays available at the same base URL. Logs for all explorer components live behind the `blockscout` alias (`./compose logs blockscout`).

Blockscout is opt-in: after a successful `./compose up`, run `./compose blockscout` once to build the explorer images, start the containers, and automatically verify the helper contracts on both rollups. Subsequent lifecycle commands (`./compose up`, `./compose restart`, etc.) will keep the explorers running. Use `./compose blockscout --skip-verification` if you only need the explorers without submitting sources.
